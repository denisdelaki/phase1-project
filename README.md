# myüë®‚ÄçüîßMechanic Phase1 project

#### By **KIPYEGON DENIS**

## Description
### Problem Statement
Often, people travel to both new and common places and destinations. These travellers' vehicles tend to develop mechanical problems that need instant attendance. Being visitors in the area with no clue on the location or contact of the mechanic who can serviced their vehicle these visitors are forced to stay on the road for as long as 24 hours or more for their mechanical problem to be solved. This challenge has rendered many tourist to insecurity problems especially in insecure places, delay in reporting to work and increased expense of the journey
### Solution 
The myüë®‚ÄçüîßMechanic site site Aims at providing not only reliable but instant connection between the travellers and the nearest mechanic. The site allows new mechanics to set up their profile detailing their name, image, location, and contacts. The details allow the traveller to easily identify the mechanic's location from their point of car breakge, call him/her to explain their mechanical problem and their current specific location
 and any other necessary details. Incase the mechanic is unreachable or their is no Mechanic within their vicinity, the client can reach out to Management through the contact Form provided or through the Social media handlers provided in the site and they can be sorted out. 
 Apart from connecting the Travellers and the mechanics, myüë®‚ÄçüîßMechanic site provides the Travellers with common mechanical problems and how they can be easily solved without the need to find a mechanic.
